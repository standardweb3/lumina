# Restaking

Restaking is enabled in Lumina in that staked assets generate liquid staking derivative. The asset is called as [Augmented Asset](../design/augmented-assets/). Augmented asset as a derivative can freely move across chains connected with Lumina, and this makes a cross-chain investment opportunity. With liquidity formed from multichain, augmented assets can be staked in liquidity pools, money markets, options, or trading funds.&#x20;
