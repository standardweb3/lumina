# Lumina

Lumina is the first Byzantine Fault Tolerant bridge to augment assets across blockchains with fail-safe mechanism.&#x20;

* **No loss on original asset from hack**: Only you have an access to claim back your original assets
* **No more wrapping**: augment assets only once, transfer it to every chains
* **Robust and transparent monitoring:**&#x20;

## Lumina is not just a bridge.

Lumina is an cross-chain intent platform where it enables users to earn the most benefit from minimum cost.&#x20;

## Stake your assets, move it everywhere.

Stake your native coins or tokens to augment into Lum assets, transfer to anywhere in blockchain.

Expand exposure to capital without permissions, and get $LUM as staking reward.

Always claim back your original asset with no worries.
