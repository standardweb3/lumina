It is far more secure to make unified wrapped token for all chains then provide liquidity for native assets than having each different wrapped token depending on from chain to another chain.&#x20;



Current wrapped tokens by bridges are only able to make duplex value transfer by lock-and-mint. Instead, Lumina locks asset first with segregating user's asset safely then provide&#x20;
